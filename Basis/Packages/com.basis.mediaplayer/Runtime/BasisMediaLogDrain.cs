/// pumps this from its own tick and the first through each frame takes the
/// whole queue, so three players in a scene still print each line once.

/// Driving it from the players rather than from a startup hook is
/// deliberate. The drain is a P/Invoke, so anything that calls it loads
/// `basis_media`; a client whose scene has no media player in it should
/// not be mapping the plugin to poll an empty queue. The cost is that
/// lines produced with no player anywhere wait in the ring until one
/// appears, or age out of it.
