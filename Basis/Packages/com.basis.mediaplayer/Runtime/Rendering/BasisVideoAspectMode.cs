// Aspect-fit mode, applied as a UV scale/offset on the sampled video texture.

// FitInside (letterbox/pillarbox) scales the bar axis > 1, so the sampled UV runs
// outside [0,1] over the bars. It only renders those as black bars with a
// shader/material that treats out-of-range UVs as black (e.g. "Basis/Media Player
// Video"). On a clamp/repeat material, or a RawImage (which follows the UI
// sampler), it smears or repeats the edge instead. There, prefer Original plus a
// RectTransform AspectRatioFitter, or FitOutside (crop, which stays within [0,1]).
