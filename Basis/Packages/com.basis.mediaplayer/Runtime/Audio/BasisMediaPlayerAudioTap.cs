/// <summary>
/// Feeds one <see cref="BasisMediaPlayerAudio"/> output AudioSource by mixing
/// its channel(s) from the shared PCM splitter on the audio thread via
/// OnAudioFilterRead, instead of a streaming AudioClip. A streaming clip
/// buffers roughly its own length ahead of the speaker (~0.5 s, and the
/// dominant output latency); OnAudioFilterRead runs per DSP block, so latency
/// collapses to the DSP buffer (~tens of ms) and is deterministic.
///
/// Spatialisation is preserved: this is a filter component on the
/// AudioSource's GameObject, so with the source's Spatialize +
/// SpatializePostEffects enabled, Unity runs it BEFORE the spatialiser, and
/// Steam Audio (HRTF, occlusion, transmission) or Unity 3D then process the
/// audio it generates exactly as they would a clip's. The source still plays
/// a short silent looping clip to keep its DSP chain active; this overwrites
/// that silence each block.
///
/// One tap per output. The owning <see cref="BasisMediaPlayerAudio"/> binds it
/// with the splitter, this output's channel taps, and a gain provider; the
/// primary tap also reports the mixed block back for the diagnostics metrics
/// (consumed samples / peak / RMS).
