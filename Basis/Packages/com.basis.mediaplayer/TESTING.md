# Testing the player in Unity

Manual checks for the managed side: shared playback, the panel and the
prefabs. None of the rows below has an automated test. The engine's tests are in
[`Native~/TESTING.md`](Native~/TESTING.md), and
[`Native~/DIAGNOSTICS.md`](Native~/DIAGNOSTICS.md) explains the captures.

| Your change affects | Run |
| --- | --- |
| Shared playback, ownership or resync (`BasisMediaPlayerNetworking`) | [Shared playback](#shared-playback) |
| The panel, transport, seeking or status (`BasisMediaPlayer`, `Runtime/UI/`) | [Media Players panel](#media-players-panel) |
| The prefabs, outputs or audio components (`Runtime/Audio/`, `Runtime/Rendering/`) | [Prefabs and components](#prefabs-and-components) |
| `UserDataReceived` | [SEI user data](#sei-user-data) |
| Which routes open a URL, the prompt, or the resolvers (`Runtime/Resolver/`) | [URL consent](#url-consent) |
| How engine events and log lines reach the Console | [Console diagnostics](#console-diagnostics) |
| Texture handling or the native plugin | [Direct3D 11 and 12](#direct3d-11-and-12) |

When the pull request is ready, report the rows as the engine guide's
[Reporting in a pull request](Native~/TESTING.md#reporting-in-a-pull-request)
describes. Where a row needs a stream, use the public endpoints in the engine
guide's [Network sources](Native~/TESTING.md#network-sources) first.

| What | How |
| --- | --- |
| Engine gate: format, lint, tests, audits, ffprobe conformance | `Native~/tools/ci.ps1` (Windows), `Native~/tools/ci.sh` (Linux); each step is described in [`Native~/TESTING.md`](Native~/TESTING.md#running-the-tests) |
| Headless playback | `Native~/bm-probe` |
| Graded playback in the editor | `Basis > Tools > Media Player > Run Smoke Test` |
| The same in batch | `-executeMethod BasisMediaSmokeTest.RunBatch` (exit code 0 on a pass; steer it with `BASIS_SMOKE_URL`, `BASIS_SMOKE_SECONDS`, `BASIS_SMOKE_LIVE`, `BASIS_SMOKE_STRICT_HOLDS`) |

## Shared playback

Needs two clients in the same world. Build the scene with `Basis > Tools >
Media Player > Test Scene > One Player (Stereo)`, then replace its source with a
URL both clients can fetch. A local file loads on the owner and fails on the
follower, which looks like a sync defect and is not one. The
lettered clips in `Native~/fixtures/captest` suit it: four 60 s H.264 clips
with a keyframe every second, each showing a letter, a colour and a running
timecode for comparing the two screens. Their music is Kevin MacLeod
(incompetech.com), CC BY 4.0, attributed in `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md`.

For the second client, save the scene, add it to Build Settings, and run a
standalone build alongside the editor. Drive the panel from the editor as
owner, except for **Owner leaves**, where the build is the owner and is closed.
Give the build its own capture filenames first; both write to the same
`persistentDataPath`.

| Row | Do | Expect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Load | One client sets a URL | The other plays it |
| Transport | Play, pause and stop from the owner | Each reaches the follower |
| Seek | Owner scrubs, playing and then paused | The follower lands within a frame or two. Paused, both show the new frame and stay paused |
| Convergence | Watch the follower for half a minute after a seek or late join | It slews onto the owner without visible jumps |
| Late join | A client joins mid-playback, on a clip that opens loud | It lands at the owner's position. Nothing from the start of the clip is shown or heard first, and the joiner never reads Playing at 0 |
| Late join, owner paused | Owner paused; a client rejoins. Try a direct `.mp4`, a page URL, and the owner pausing (or resuming) while the client loads | It lands paused on the owner's frame, silently, without passing through Playing or showing the clip's first frame, and plays when the owner does. If the owner resumed during loading, it comes up playing at the owner's position |
| Ownership | The second client takes control | The first becomes a follower; neither fights |
| Late join, owner plays mid-load | Owner paused; a client joins, and the owner presses **Play** while the client is still loading | It comes up Buffering until its seek lands, then Playing at the owner's position. The status never reads Playing while the picture is still the pre-seek one |
| Owner leaves | Close the owner mid-playback | The follower keeps playing |
| Admin only | `AdminOnly` on, second client without permission | It cannot take control and has no playback tab |
| Open to everyone | `AnyoneCanControl` on | The other client gains the controls without reopening the panel |
| Live source | A live stream | No position sync; each client at its own live edge |
| Stalled owner | Stall the owner's network | The follower holds position |
| Resync everyone | Drift a follower, owner presses **Resync Everyone** | All clients land on the owner's position. No prompt |
| Resync keeps the owner's place | **Resync Everyone** while playing, on a direct `.mp4` and a page URL | The owner carries on from where it was, not from zero |
| Resync while stopped | **Resync Everyone** after stopping, URL still held | Nothing happens |
| Resync a page URL | **Resync Everyone** well into a YouTube or Twitch source | All clients land together at the owner's position, not zero, with no seek before the reload. The shared URL stays the page URL |
| Join mid-resync | Join during a resync reopen | Lands at the owner's position, not near zero |
| Local resync | A follower presses **Local Resync** | Only that client reopens |
| Inspector buttons | The same two presses from the networking component's inspector, in Play Mode | Same as from the panel |
| Untrusted URL | The owner sets a URL on a host outside `BasisTrustedUrls` | The follower loads it with no prompt |
| A video hours long | Owner seeks deep into a fragmented video of two hours or more, then a client joins. Try a direct URL (make one with `ffmpeg -stream_loop -1 -i <clip> -t 7200 -c copy -movflags +frag_keyframe+empty_moov+default_base_moof+global_sidx -frag_duration 2000000 out.mp4` and serve it with byte ranges) and `https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNS5o3VJ0-A` (11 h, H.264) | Opens as fast as a short video; the joiner lands beside the owner |

No follower may snap to the start during any resync, even briefly. With the
yt-dlp package installed, also check that page URLs reach other clients as page
URLs, never as `googlevideo` or other CDN URLs.

## Media Players panel

One client, in a scene with more than one player.

| Row | Do | Expect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Visibility | A scene with no players, then one | The menu entry appears with the first player |
| Selection | Switch players | Status, URL and controls follow |
| Scrubber | Drag the seek bar, playing and paused | One seek when the handle stops, no bounce back, and the frame at the dropped position (not the keyframe before it). Paused stays paused |
| Chained scrub | On a WebM or Ogg Opus file, drag the seek bar, then drag it again before the first seek lands | The handle stays on the second position until that seek lands, never showing the first target or the old playhead. Playback lands on the second position |
| Sparse keyframes | On a video whose keyframes are far apart (a low frame rate, or one keyframe for the whole clip), seek forwards and back between keyframes, both within 720 frames of the keyframe before the target (or 12 s, whichever is longer) and beyond it | Within it, playback goes on from the dropped position, not the keyframe before it, and the handle stays there. Beyond it, playback goes on from that keyframe and the handle moves there once the seek lands, not after a long hold on the dropped position |
| Slow decoder | Start the player with `BASIS_MEDIA_SLOW_VIDEO_DECODE_MS=80` in its environment and play an on-demand source with sound, and one with captions or SEI data | Sound unbroken at real time. The picture moves, holds and rejoins, in step whenever it moves. Captions and user data stay on time. `LateVideoSkip` in the Console. Unset the variable afterwards |
| Lip sync | Play an on-demand video with speech, then a live RTSP stream | Sound and picture land together; the sound does not trail the picture |
| Before the first frame | Open a live RTSP stream and a fragmented AV1 MP4, watching the screen from the moment the panel reads Buffering | The screen keeps its placeholder until the first frame shows, never white or grey. The debug window's output texture pill reads NO until then |
| Long pause | Pause a minute, then play, on a video and an audio-only file | Resumes with no error |
| Live stream | Open one | The seek bar hides |
| MPEG-TS file | Open an on-demand `.ts` or `.m2ts` over HTTPS, not through HLS | Plays from the start. The duration reads 0 and the seek bar hides |
| WAV file | With the yt-dlp package installed, open a 7.1 `.wav` over HTTPS on the multi-channel prefab | Opens straight away with no yt-dlp lines in the Console, and all eight outputs carry sound |
| Captions | Toggle captions, switch player | The setting applies to every player |
| Subtitles | A source with subtitle files | The language row shows only with captions on |
| Status | Watch a load, then open a URL that fails (a host that does not exist) | Connecting, Buffering, Playing, with the resolution. A failure shows its reason in red, not only a code |
| Refused codec, nothing else | A VP8 WebM with no audio | Error within a second or two, the reason naming VP8 as unsupported |
| Refused video, audio plays | HEVC in an MPEG-TS file with AAC | The sound plays, and an amber **Issue:** line says the video track announced no frame size |
| Refused track in the file | An MP4 whose video is a codec the player does not take (an MPEG-4 Part 2 `mp4v` track, say), with AAC beside it | The sound plays, and the **Issue:** line names the codec |
| Admin tab | With and without `*` | Shown only with it, on a networked player |
| Markup injection | A title containing `</noparse>` and `<b>` | Shown literally |

## Prefabs and components

After changing their components, check `MediaPlayerStreaming` and
`MediaPlayerMultiChannelStreaming`: no missing scripts, outputs wired to their
channels (all eight on the multi-channel one), the screen showing the picture,
and the networking component's permission fields as intended.

On `BasisVideoMaterialOutput`, the Picture foldout shows four sliders at 1, and
a moved slider keeps its value after Play Mode. `BasisVideoPicture` must stay
`[System.Serializable]` or the foldout is empty.

The first Play Mode after a script reload stalls for a few seconds; judge
startup in a build or on the second load.

## SEI user data

Against `Native~/fixtures/h264-sei-userdata-640x360-30fps.ts` over HTTP, with a
script logging `UserDataReceived`:

| Row | Do | Expect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Ordered delivery | Play | Frame indices 0 to 179 in order, each as playback reaches it, and x264's `dc45e9bd-…` once at the start |
| Late subscriber | Subscribe a few seconds in | Starts with the message then due |
| Subscriber one frame late | Subscribe from `Update` after `Open` | Receives the first message |

## URL consent

A URL on a host outside `BasisTrustedUrls` prompts before it opens. Pick a host
that is not on the built-in list (`BasisTrustedUrls.GetBuiltIn()`), and clear
the user list (`ClearAll()`) between rows that remember. One client unless
stated.

| Row | Do | Expect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Authored URL | A scene player with an untrusted URL and **Play On Start**, enter Play Mode | The prompt shows; nothing opens until **Accept**. **Decline** leaves the player idle |
| Panel URL | Type the same URL into the Media Players panel | Opens with no prompt |
| Declined, then Play | **Decline** the authored prompt, then press the panel's **Play** | Prompts again |
| Re-open | Let a source end, or **Local Resync** with no networking, then **Play** | Re-opens with no prompt |
| Remember | Accept with Remember set to the URL, then the host, then the domain, re-entering Play Mode each time | The next entry does not prompt; `GetUserAdded()` shows the pattern |
| Play while pending | Press the panel's **Play** while the prompt is up, then **Accept** | Plays as soon as the source is up |
| Page URL | An untrusted YouTube page URL, with the yt-dlp package installed | One prompt; the extracted stream opens with no second one |
| Split pair | A script calls `Open(video, audio)` with the audio leg on an untrusted host | Prompts for the audio URL as well; nothing opens until both are accepted |
| World script sets the room's URL | A script calls `SetUrl` on the networking component with an untrusted URL, two clients | The owner is asked first; **Decline** sends nothing, and the follower loads only after **Accept** |

Closing the menu does not answer the prompt. It moves to the notification list,
where it can be brought back up or dismissed; a dismissal is a decline.

## Console diagnostics

Engine events appear as `[BasisMedia +12.412s] AudioTrim/AudioRing: …`, stamped
with the session clock used in the captures. Free-text engine lines appear as
`[BasisMedia process +N.NNNs] …`, timed from the plugin's first line. A code
newer than the managed side prints as a number.

| Row | Do | Expect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Named codes | Play any source | `Code/Stage` lines; `StateChange/Clock` within a second of opening |
| No stack traces | Any player, in the Editor | Log-level lines have no call stack (builds keep them) |
| Unknown code | Delete `AudioTrim = 15` from `BmEventCode`, play a source that trims | The line reads `15/AudioRing`. Restore |
| Burst | Set `EventDrainBatch` to 4, open a source | The open's events arrive in one frame. Restore |
| Full log | Set `SessionDiag::default`'s cap to 2, rebuild, play | `diagnostics log full: N event(s) refused, M this session`. Restore |
| Cut detail | Open a very long bad URL | The `Error/Source` line ends in `…` |
| Device events | Open a source, then exit Play Mode | A free-text line `unity device event: initialize, renderer 2` (18 on Direct3D 12) once at start-up, and a `shutdown` line on exit. On Quest, `device_event: type 0, renderer 21` in logcat |
| Two sessions | With **Engine capture** on, open one source, then another, in one Play Mode entry | Both captures carry a numeric `av_offset_us` once sound and picture run, and neither stays on the sentinel |
| Transport line | Play any RTSP stream (e.g. `rtsp://stream.vrcdn.live/live/vrcdn`) | `rtsp transport: …` within a second |
| One copy | Three players, a stream on one | Each `process` line once |
| Severity | Open a bad URL | `session error:` in red, with no crash report |
| Overrun | Error in a loop with the editor paused, then resume | The oldest lines are dropped |
| Frame budget | Set `EventDrainPerTick` to 8 and `DrainPerFrame` to 4, provoke a burst | Every line arrives, over several frames. Restore |

## Direct3D 11 and 12

Start the Editor or a build once with `-force-d3d11` and once with
`-force-d3d12`, and run each row on both. The log names the API in use: the
project's `Logs/Editor.log` for the Editor, `Player.log` for a build, or the
file given with `-logFile <path>`.

| Row | Do | Expect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Playback | Play a video with sound, seek forwards and back, pause, resume | Picture and sound throughout, seeks land on their target, the pause holds its frame, and no `consumer open failed` line |
| Render-thread cost | With `BasisMediaPlayerDiagnostics` recording, leave a minute of playback untouched, then a minute with the player idle | Mean frame time within 0.1 ms of the idle minute, and no more than three extra frames over 33 ms. If either misses, run both minutes again; a second miss is a regression |

## Still needs a person
