    /// arbitrary user-uploaded avatars, so for the several frames the queue took to drain, an
    /// avatar's real body could sit fully visible and fully lit before its clothing renderers caught
    /// up — reported by players as avatars reading as nude while loading. There is no hide-then-
    /// reveal ORDERING that is safe for arbitrary UGC (flipping the order just moves the exposure
    /// onto whichever content puts its covering geometry on the renderer type that goes last), so

    /// with it. Do not re-enable this by hiding renderers again; a safe redesign would need to keep
    /// 100% of the avatar's geometry visible at all times (e.g. warm PSOs by swapping each renderer
    /// to a pre-warmed placeholder MATERIAL rather than toggling Renderer.enabled) before this comes
