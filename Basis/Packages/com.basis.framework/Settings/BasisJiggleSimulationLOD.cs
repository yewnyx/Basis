/// <summary>
/// Distance-based pause of remote avatars' jiggle simulation itself — distinct from
/// <see cref="BasisJiggleColliderLOD"/>, which only trims the colliders other jiggle chains bounce
/// off. A registered jiggle tree pays a Verlet integrate plus a transform read/write every physics
/// tick regardless of whether anyone can actually see it move. Past the cutoff distance, a remote's
/// <see cref="GatorDragonGames.JigglePhysics.JiggleRig"/> components are disabled, which unregisters
/// their trees from the global simulation via the package's own OnDisable -&gt; RemoveJiggleTreeSegment
/// path; re-enabling re-adds them, which reseeds the verlet state from the current animated bone pose
/// rather than resuming mid-motion. That reseed-on-return is the deliberate trade for paying zero
/// simulation cost on a far/occluded avatar's jiggle bones instead of a reduced-but-nonzero rate. The
/// local player is never touched.
