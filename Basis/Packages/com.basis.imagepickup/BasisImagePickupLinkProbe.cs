    /// round trip is measured against the server, the number also rises when the server is the congested
    /// party — which wants the same response.
    ///
    /// Depth of this client's own outgoing reliable queue is the emergency signal. It moves the moment the
    /// transport stops draining as fast as the chunks arrive, without waiting a round trip for the news, and
    /// it is what the transport shell exposes in place of LiteNetLib's per-peer loss counters.
    ///
    /// This governs the local uplink only. The relay's fan-out budget stays a fixed ceiling — a fast local
    /// line is no reason to make a server forward more.
