/// Where the ray traced mode is being looked from - EVERY camera drawing the effect this frame, not just

///
/// The acceleration structure, the light budget and the emitter budget are all built once per frame and
/// shared by every camera, which is what keeps a mirror, a photo camera and the player's eye from each
/// rebuilding one. What they were shared AROUND, though, was a single position: the first camera of the
/// frame. Everything that ranks or culls by distance - skinned meshes past Skinned Max Distance, the
/// lights that fit the budget, the emitters that fit what is left - therefore answered for that camera
/// and no other.
///
/// The handheld camera is the case where the two positions come apart by more than a rounding error. It
/// can be flown across the room, set to follow from behind, or simply left on a table pointing back at
/// the player, and the moment it is further than Skinned Max Distance from the player's head every avatar
/// standing in front of it is missing from the structure it traces: the photo shows a room where nobody
/// bounces any light and nobody casts a traced shadow, beside a direct view of the same room where they
/// all do. No setting names it, because both cameras are running the same enabled, correctly configured
/// effect.
///
/// So distance is measured to the NEAREST viewer rather than to THE viewer. One structure, one budget,
/// built to cover everything anybody is looking at. The cost is that the budgets are now shared in the
/// literal sense - a light close to the handheld camera can take a slot from one that was only just
/// making the cut for the player - which is the honest trade for two viewpoints out of one list, and far
/// cheaper than a second structure per camera per frame.
