/// This used to be a VolumeComponent blended out of URP's volume stack, and the volume model cost far

/// a scene had authored, which meant a scene volume and the player's settings quietly disagreed and the
/// higher priority won; it wrote the player's values into the pipeline's SHARED default profile assets
/// and had to remember the authored values to put back, so a crash or a skipped OnDestroy left a profile
/// on disk holding somebody's runtime state; and because the handheld camera renders on its own volume
/// layer, a duplicate volume had to be built per uncovered layer just so a second camera could see the
/// same numbers. Three mechanisms, all of them load-bearing, none of them visible in a debugger - and
/// the effect's on/off state depended on all three agreeing.
///
/// The settings provider is the source of truth now and writes here directly. What a camera renders with
