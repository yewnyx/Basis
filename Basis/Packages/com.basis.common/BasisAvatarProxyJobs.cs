/// The per frame half of <see cref="BasisAvatarProxy"/>: every limb's matrix for the room, in one flat
/// array that consumers index into rather than each keeping a copy.
///
/// ⚠️ A JOB VERSION CANNOT BE SCHEDULED FROM INSIDE THE RENDER PIPELINE. An earlier attempt scheduled
/// the gather from RenderPipelineManager.beginFrameRendering and crashed the editor:
///
///     InvalidOperationException: The previously scheduled job ZBinningJob writes to the
///     NativeArray`1[System.UInt32] ZBinningJob.bins. You must call JobHandle.Complete() on the job
///     ZBinningJob, before you can write to it safely.
///
/// ZBinningJob is URP's OWN light binning job — scheduling and completing there is a sync point in the
/// middle of somebody else's job graph, and the safety system is right to refuse it.
///
/// So the split is: <see cref="ScheduleBeforeRender"/> runs on Application.onBeforeRender at
/// BeforeRenderOrder int.MaxValue — after Basis has run its IK on the default-order handler, before URP
/// exists for the frame — and <see cref="Run"/> (beginContextRendering) only joins and publishes. The poses
/// are still one sample at one instant for every consumer; the sample just happens a hair earlier, at the
/// last onBeforeRender slot instead of the first pipeline callback, with nothing writing bones in between.
/// A destroyed bone is skipped by the transform job and keeps its last matrix until the next rebuild,
/// exactly as the managed loop's null-skip did.
