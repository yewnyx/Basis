/// <summary>
/// An avatar's body as a handful of capsules on its bones, instead of its actual skinned mesh.
///
/// Lives in Common because global illumination and ambient occlusion both trace the same avatars and hit
/// the same wall. Sharing it is not only about duplicated source: BasisAvatarProxyPose below makes the two
/// effects share the per frame WORK as well, so the bones are read and the limb matrices built once for a
/// room however many tracers are looking at it.
///
/// The dynamic path re-bakes a SkinnedMeshRenderer into a real mesh and swaps that mesh into the
/// acceleration structure. That is expensive enough to need a per-frame budget, the budget is spent
/// round-robin, and the result is that the body which occludes and bounces light is NOT the body on
/// screen - it is that avatar's pose from up to (avatars / budget) x interval frames ago, staggered
/// differently for every person in the room. When an avatar's turn finally comes round its traced pose
/// jumps several frames at once, which the temporal filter can only smear. That is the artifacting:
/// occlusion trailing a limb, contact shadows detached from the foot casting them, and a wrongness that
/// looks random precisely because everyone is stale by a different amount.
///
/// None of that is a tuning problem. The backend offers no BLAS refit and no vertex-buffer instance
/// (<c>MeshInstanceDesc</c> takes a Mesh), so a deformed mesh can only be updated by removing and
/// re-adding it - a full rebuild, every pose, forever.
///
/// So the body stops being geometry that deforms and becomes geometry that MOVES. One unit capsule mesh
/// is shared by every limb of every avatar, so there is exactly one BLAS for all of them and it never
/// changes; a pose update is UpdateInstanceTransform per limb, which needs no bake, no readback and no
/// rebuild. Every avatar updates every frame and the staleness is gone, not reduced.
///
/// What it costs is detail: fingers, hair and loose clothing are not in these capsules. At the
/// resolutions this runs at - a half resolution gather through a denoiser - the bounce off a hand is a
/// soft patch of light either way, and a silhouette in roughly the right place every frame beats an
/// exact one several frames late.
