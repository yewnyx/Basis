/// their own content by type do not each pay for the discovery.
///
/// <c>FindObjectsByType</c> walks every loaded object of a type and allocates twice - once natively and
/// once more through <c>Resources.ConvertObjects</c> to hand back a typed array - so it is the sort of
/// call that should happen once for the frame and be read by everybody, not once per interested party.
/// Global illumination and ray traced ambient occlusion want exactly the same two sets (every renderer,
/// every animator) on exactly the same cadence, and before this they each took their own copy: five
/// full-scene walks per rescan window where three would do.
///
/// The cache is aged rather than framed on purpose. Tying it to the frame would only dedupe consumers
/// that happen to scan on the SAME frame, which would force them into lockstep - the opposite of what is
/// wanted, since spreading the scans across different frames is what keeps any one frame cheap. An age
/// lets a consumer say "anything from the last two seconds will do", so whoever asks first pays and
/// everyone asking later in the window reads the same array for nothing, whatever frame they are on.
///
/// The arrays are shared and must be treated as read only. They also hold references for as long as they
/// are cached, so an entry may be a destroyed object by the time it is read: every consumer already null
/// checks, because that was equally true of a freshly taken array the moment anything was destroyed.
