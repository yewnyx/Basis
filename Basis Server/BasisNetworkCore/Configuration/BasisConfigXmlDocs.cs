The remainder of the period is not spare: the queue drain, message processing, the distance slice and the transport kick all run in the same tick, and how much they cost is a property of the machine - which is why this is a setting and not a constant. Too high and the send pass comfortably fits its budget while the tick overruns regardless; the load controller then starts shedding players and nothing in the logs points here. Too low and the pool is sized wider than the box while the tick sits half idle. The process cannot fit this itself, because the send pass has no view of what the phases beside it cost, so BasisServerBenchmark measures the split under load and writes the value. By hand: from the [CPU/POP] line take the budget duty times this percentage to get the send pass's share of the tick, subtract it from tick-ms over interval-ms to get what everything else costs, and leave that plus about ten points of headroom out of this number.

WARNING: this used to be a fixed 256, which is too small to be only a backstop - at 2000 players it discarded roughly half of every avatar update produced, and because discarding is cheaper than sending, the reduction system read the resulting fast ticks as spare capacity and produced even more.

This queue is allowed to be DEEPER than the bulk one, which sounds backwards and is the whole point: bulk depth buys avatar frames that the next frame replaces anyway, while voice depth buys audio that has no replacement.
